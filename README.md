# Gator-Raider
A project created in Java in which I aimed to utilize tools given to me by my professor, which essentially included a functional game of Gator Raider in the style of Pac-Man, to develop an AI for the player character that could gain the maximum amount of points at any given time.
The AI activates automatically and moves arount the board to create an ideal game.
